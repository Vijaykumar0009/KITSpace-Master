# The Kitspace Code of Conduct

We are committed to making working on Kitspace an inclusive and welcoming environment. We've set these ground rules to make it abundantly clear that any kind of harassment is not acceptable so that everyone can feel comfortable in joining in. Everybody in the Kitspace community is required to abide by this code of conduct, both at any events and on any online channels.

## The Rules

We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, or discriminatory behaviour of any form. Specifically:

- Do not engage in homophobic, biphobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise prejudiced behaviour.
- Do not harass people. Stalking, unconsented physical contact, threatening behaviour, and unwanted sexual attention is harassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.
- Everyone's personal space is their own. If you are asked to leave someone alone you must respect this.
- Some people may not want to be filmed or photographed. You must have consent from anyone who is identifiable in a photo or video.
- Sexualised language and imagery is not appropriate in public, or in talks or sessions which do not deal directly with such topics.
- Aggression and elitism are not welcome â€” do not belittle people for their knowledge or experience.

## Reporting an Incident

If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct, you can get in touch with us in the following ways:

- Drop us an email at conduct@kitspace.org
- At an event: find a member of event staff (they'll be clearly identifiable) and let them know. All our volunteer staff will be briefed on how to handle reports.

## Our Response

During our events, we aim to reach a decision on all conduct issues within 1 hour. Outside of events, we will respond within one week maximum.

All reports will be taken seriously and will be considered in confidence.

If we believe you have violated this code of conduct, we will normally issue you with a warning, with which you are expected to comply. If your behaviour continues, we may eject you from the event and ban you from any online channels.

Serious breaches, including sexual or physical assault, will result in your immediate ejection from the event and a ban from all future Kitspace events. We may involve the police, with the consent of the victim.
